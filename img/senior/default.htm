<span style="background-color: #FF0000">Happy Birthday, Gavin!</span></font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Comic Sans MS">You asked Dad several 
times for a web site where you could have a Forum and other advanced features. 
Welcome to the new gavinmcdowell.com! This web site is hosted at godaddy.com, 
sharing the account of alternities.com. Notice, though, that the URL says
<a href="http://www.gavinmcdowell.com">http://www.gavinmcdowell.com</a>. </font>
</p>
<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Comic Sans MS">This is not URL 
redirection. This is not a vanity URL. This is actual Web hosting for your 
domain, and it comes with many optional free applications, and high-end language 
support. We will explore the possibilities together, but here are some I know 
about: You can have Forums, a blog, a Photo Gallery, a guestbook--you can 
program in ASP or PHP or .NET.&nbsp; You could even host personal videos or 
music (we'll work out the size/bandwidth limits as we go, but this account has 
10,000 times the storage of the soon-to-be-gone AT&amp;T account). </font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="6" face="Comic Sans MS">You can have your own <i>
username@gavinmcdowell.com</i> e-mail accounts, too, including &quot;throwaway&quot; 
accounts for registering on other Web sites.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6">You will have to read, 
agree to, and follow the GoDaddy terms of service. But if you show you're 
responsible, you'll be given full administrative rights over your own site. 
You'll be able to use FrontPage 2003 to create and maintain your site, and to 
publish your site without anyone's assistance. </font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="6">We can't promise you 
eyeballs, but we hope this will be an opportunity for personal and creative 
self-expression. (Learn enough about Web design and programming along the way, 
and a couple years down the road you might even find you've created your own 
summer job!)</font></p>
<p align="center"><font size="7" face="Algerian" color="#FF0000">Love, Mom &amp; Dad</font></p>
